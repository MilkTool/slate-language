Mars 13, 2005
I decided to move stuff to darcs.
Making so, I found that I began adding stuff to declare events
in SDLgfxLib2.slate, but that it don't work at all, so I commented it
out. BTW I renamed it to SDLgfxLib.slate, and change the directory
structure to be under src/ui/SDL rather than src/plugins/SDL.

February 14, 2005
-Finally found that SDLgfxLib2.slate was not able to use #PSurf
(Surface Pointer) because I was not passing &argumentFormats: SDLLib argFormatOverrides. to installMethodsForDefs:

February 4, 2005
-fixed some missing case about test2.slate (see February 2), and
remove some old comments saying that it was showing nothing (which
was now false, they worked)

so fixing the bug with LoadBMP.
