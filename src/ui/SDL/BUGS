Known problems
--------------
-none known for now (you can help by telling me the ones
I forget, like I have the feeling colors are not always correct)

Concerns
--------
-On Windows, names of the dll files seems different than on my
Debian machine (seems to have just one file: SDL.dll, where on
Debian I have many: libSDL_gfx.so, libSDL_sge.so, etc.).
It is still unclear if that unique SDL.dlll file contains the
functions that are in libSDL_gfx.so.
I did not try to find a solution to this 'problem' yet.
