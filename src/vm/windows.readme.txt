Windows native VM
-----------------

This directory contains a VisualStudio project with which it's possible to
compile a native Windows VM. Output files are slate.exe and slatedebug.exe
in the Slate root directory for the release and debug executables. The
console dll project puts its output dll next to the executables, so Windows
can find the dll.

There were optimization bugs in versions previous to Visual C++ Express
Edition Beta (VS 8) that compiled a non-functioning VM, so we recommend
using a recent version.

Setting up Visual C++ Express
-----------------------------

To install VS8 need to do/install/read/download the following:

Visual C++ Express:
http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/

This is obviously the IDE. Install it and open the project files with it.

"msinttypes":
http://code.google.com/p/msinttypes/

This provides the headers inttypes.h and stdint.h which are POSIX headers
that Windows does not provide for some basic portable integer types.

Pthreads-Win32:
http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/

This provides POSIX threads functionality on Windows, used by a few parts of
the VM. The shared library and header files should be placed or included in
the path of the project.
