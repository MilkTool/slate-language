High/Immediate importance:

* get more users and developers


Medium importantance:

* fix parser crashes

* fix repl debugger (after calling :up too much)

* unit tests for all of the basic slate functionality


Not too important:

* fix the fixme parts in vm.c

* unoptimize functions--seems the method cache is not getting reset on
   new definitions sometimes

* add direct threading code by adding an object type with function pointers, make sure the GC
   handles that correctly when the file is saved and loaded


Wishlist:

* full GUI editor

* web browser

* web server
