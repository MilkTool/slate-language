description       A prototype-based object-oriented programming language
long_description  Slate is a prototype-based object-oriented \
                  programming language based on Self, CLOS, and \
                  Smalltalk-80. Slate syntax is intended to be as \
                  familiar as possible to a Smalltalker, for the \
                  clarity of messages as phrases. Unlike the Smalltalk \
                  family, methods within Slate can be assigned to a \
                  signature of objects, instead of being installed on \
                  one favored receiver. Slate has also many further \
                  expansions of the semantics which enable more \
                  concise and natural ways to express solutions to \
                  problems.
